                <p>&#8195;We are community of developers that love to code and
                    help each other. We are looking for smart, friendly,
                    self-directed and intellectually curious people who
                    enjoy programming and want to get significantly better.
                     We are passionate about programming and think that everybody
                    can pick it up or switch to the different field at any time
                    they want, given some amount of motivation, dedication and hard
                    work. Nevertheless, doing that on one's own can be challenging
                    when it comes to continuing without support from surrounding
                    people, such situation really beats the motivation, especially
                    when encountering either boring or impossible to do (at first glance)
                    task or illogical aspect of programming language you can't
                    just grasp. That's the reason behind us getting together and
                    just grasp. That's the reason behind us getting together and
                    sharing knowledge. Our initiative is community driven, making
                    it super-flexible in terms of adapting to what students want
                    while keeping in mind the main idea - learn something new and
                    do it in the fun way, creating something meaningful along the
